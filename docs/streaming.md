# Streaming

## Local machine setup

Easiest way to stream is to use [OBS](https://obsproject.com/). If you need to stream simultaneously to multiple platforms (pump.fun, X, Twitch), use multistreaming with custom RTMP from [Restream](https://restream.io/multistreaming) or [Streamyard](https://streamyard.com/multistreaming)

## Remote machine setup

With remote streaming one could go live 24/7 freeing local machine load. It is helpful for streaming content (your art, copyright free music, etc.) or web pages (games, automated trading, etc.)

üê≥ Docker image with ffmpeg/Puppeteer setup for recording and streaming coming soon...
